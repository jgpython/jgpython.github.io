# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository serves as a collection of my work, showcasing my journey in cybersecurity and information security. As a professional with a background in physical security and academic training in **Computer Information Systems** and **Cybersecurity**, I am passionate about safeguarding data, systems, and networks from emerging threats.

## About Me

I have a dual Bachelor’s degree in **Psychology & Criminal Justice** and am currently pursuing a Master’s in **Computer Information Systems** with a focus on cybersecurity. My certifications include **CompTIA A+**, **Network+**, and a **Class D Security License** from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

I work full-time at **Walt Disney World** as a Physical Security Professional, while continuing to expand my expertise in the field of cybersecurity. My portfolio here highlights my skills, projects, blog articles, and tutorials.

## Featured Projects

- **Home Lab Setup for Cybersecurity**: A comprehensive project where I document the setup of my personal cybersecurity home lab using pfSense, Kali Linux, and Splunk.
- **Penetration Testing on Metasploitable 2**: Exploiting various vulnerabilities on the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine using tools like Nessus and Metasploit.
- **Malware Analysis Sandbox**: Set up a sandbox environment to perform malware analysis and reverse engineering.

## Blog Articles

Here’s a collection of my articles published on Medium, where I write about cybersecurity topics, tutorials, and home lab setups:
