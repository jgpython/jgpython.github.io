# Jose Pacheco - Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Portfolio**, where I showcase my journey in cybersecurity. This GitHub page contains a collection of my projects, educational background, certifications, and professional experience, all focused on securing systems, networks, and data from emerging threats.

## About Me

I am currently working at **Walt Disney World** while pursuing a **Master's in Computer Information Systems (CIS)**, with a specialization in **Cybersecurity**. My background in both physical and information security has provided me with a unique perspective on protecting sensitive systems.

I have certifications in **CompTIA A+** and **CompTIA Network+**, and I am working towards completing **Security+**. My goal is to become a **Security Analyst**, where I can leverage my analytical abilities and cybersecurity knowledge to protect systems from cyber threats.

## Projects

I’ve worked on a range of projects, from penetration testing to security monitoring and defensive security. These projects are built using tools like **Metasploit**, **Nessus**, **Wireshark**, **Splunk**, and **Python** for automation. Here are some key projects:

- **[The Hasher](https://github.com/jgpython/the_hasher)**: A Python tool for password hashing with MD5, SHA256, SHA512, and SHA1.
- **[Exploiting PostgreSQL on Metasploitable 2](https://medium.com/@josegpach/exploiting-postgresql-on-metasploitable-2-ec59c2e63328)**: Vulnerability analysis and database exploitation.
- **[Exploiting FTP Vulnerabilities on Metasploitable 2](https://medium.com/@josegpach/exploiting-ftp-vulnerabilities-on-metasploitable-2-bbd935d42e23)**: Exploitation of weak FTP service configurations.
- **[SMB Enumeration and Exploitation in CTFs](https://medium.com/@josegpach/smb-enumeration-and-exploitation-in-ctfs-be6fc147af76)**: Enumerating and exploiting SMB vulnerabilities.
- **[Defensive Security: Blocking a Malicious IP](https://medium.com/@josegpach/practical-example-of-defensive-security-blocking-a-malicious-ip-96721a08c9b5)**: Blocking IPs to protect networks from potential attacks.
