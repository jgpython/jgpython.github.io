# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio, where I showcase my journey in the field, including my projects, certifications, and practical experiences in both physical and information security.

Currently, I am working at **Walt Disney World** while pursuing a **Master's in Computer Information Systems (CIS)** with a focus on **Cybersecurity**. I specialize in securing systems, networks, and data from modern threats. Below you will find links to my featured projects, certifications, and ways to connect with me.

## About Me

With certifications such as **CompTIA A+** and **Network+**, and practical experience in both physical and cybersecurity, I focus on securing data, setting up home labs for hands-on learning, and conducting vulnerability assessments in virtual environments. I combine academic knowledge with real-world experience to improve data security across multiple layers.
